                                <h3>Rationale of the Club</h3>
                                <p>The Davis Quantum Journal Club (DQJC) rises from the acknowledgment that Information Theory and Information Technologies have dramatically improved our ability to understand physical systems and exert control on them. The related research activity of the past 50 years has proven to be of wide relevance across the scientific community because of its intrinsic interdisciplinarity. In parallel with the development of Information Science and Technologies, we have dramatically improved both our theoretical understanding of microscopic systems and our experimental ability to study and manipulate them, deep into the realm of quantum mechanics. As a result, Quantum Information Science has slowly emerged as a theoretical and experimental effort to fulfill the promise of a more powerful future technology.
                                <br>In this sense, the DQJC constitutes an effort to capitalize on the widespread interest towards Quantum Information Science by creating a community-owned <em>third</em> space where students and researchers with different backgrounds and goals can learn, discuss and address aspects of Quantum Information Science. </p>

                                <h3>Format of Meetings</h3>
                                <p>The DQJC will explore a variation of the standard format of a topic-oriented Journal Club. A topic of common relevance will be identified and <u>two speakers</u> will alternately present and discuss with the audience its major experimental and theoretical aspects. Each of them will have 20 minutes to present and 10 minutes to answer specific questions from the audience. After the talks, we will open the discussion to the audience for 30 minutes. Snacks and non-alcoholic beverages will be provided.</p>

                                <h3>Goals</h3>
                                    <span>
                                    Given the wide-spread relevance of Information Theory, the primary goal of the Davis Quantum Journal Club is to start and sustain a community-based, intra- and inter-departmental discussion on Quantum Information Science. 
                                    <br> Secondary goals include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Foster collaboration among various departments at U.C. Davis</li>
                                        <li>Provide a space where students with different backgrounds can gain appropriate knowledge, find important resources and engage in the ongoing scientific debate about Quantum Information Science and Quantum Information Technologies.</li>
                                        <li>Stimulate a more comprehensive study of Information Science which includes the perks of both the experimental and theoretical approach.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </span>
