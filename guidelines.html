                                <span>Considering the widespread interest in Quantum Information Science, it is important to keep in mind that the expected audience does not have a specific scientific profile. People coming from at least 4 different departments have shown a high degree of interest: Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Math and Material Science. Moreover, the expected background of the audience can range from undergraduates to full professors. As a result of this, the speakers are highly encouraged to:</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Tailor their presentations to a general - but still scientific - audience.</li>
                                    <li>Use a generic (as opposed to field-specific) language, to lower the barrier of understanding and avoid the implicit assumptions due to the field-specific background we all have.</li>
                                    <li>Keep in mind that we might have students and professors with a low degree of experience and understanding of quantum mechanics and its perks. As such, the speakers should be open and encourage questions from the audience.</li>
                                    <li>Coordinate with the speaker they have been paired-up with to discuss a common strategy. This aims at providing a coherent and cohesive picture of the chosen topic, both from the experimental and theoretical perspective.</li>
                                </ul>
